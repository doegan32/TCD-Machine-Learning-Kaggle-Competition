# Trinity College Dublin - Machine Learning Kaggle Competition
## Goal: Predict the income

### Donal Egan's entry for for TCD Machine Learning (course CS7CS4 2019/2020) Kaggle Competition.
### The entry finished in the top 6% of 320 entries. 

To run the code in the jupyter-notebook the following libraries are required:
1. numpy;
2. pandas;
3. sklearn (scikit-learn);
4. seaborn.

The following .csv files must be saved in the same folder as the jupyter-notebook:
1. "tcd ml 2019-20 income prediction training (with labels).csv";
2. "tcd ml 2019-20 income prediction test (without labels).csv"

The model is trained on the data from "tcd ml 2019-20 income prediction training (with labels).csv". The goal of the competition was to predict the income for each instance in
"tcd ml 2019-20 income prediction test (without labels).csv". Predictions are output to ‚Å®"attempt10.csv". 

"tcd ml 2019-20 income prediction submission file10.csv" contains the predictions I submitted for the competition.
